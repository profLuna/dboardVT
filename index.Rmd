Massachusetts needs progressive and equitable investment in transportation. This investment should prioritize communities that have borne the brunt of burdens from the current transportation system, and which have benefited the least from the same system.

Our analysis shows that areas with high percentages of priority populations and the highest rankings of multiple cumulative environmental burdens fall in the eastern and southern regions of state, particularly around the largest urban areas. Limited English speaking households and people of color most frequently experience the greatest number and types of burdens, especially for air quality, heat, and flood or evacuation risks. Priority populations, especially those over 64 and in lower income households, in rural and suburban areas, lack transportation options and face high costs for transportation.

These interactive figures identify communities across Massachusetts that are most overburdened and most vulnerable to transportation-related environmental burdens or the absence of transportation-related benefits.

### About the map

This map shows communities (i.e. Census Block Groups) with high percentages of one or more priority population groups (80th percentile for the state) *AND* that experience the highest burdens (80th percentile for the state) for one or more categories of environmental burdens. 

Priority populations represent demographic groups that environmental justice policy and research have identified as being especially vulnerable to environmental burdens as a consequence of social or economic disadvantage, physical vulnerability, or historic and persistent discrimination and inequality. These include:

* People of color (i.e., persons who are of Hispanic ethnicity or racially not White)
* Low income persons (i.e., income less than 200% of the poverty line)
* Limited English speaking households (i.e., households where no adult speaks English "very well")
* Adults 25 years or older without a high school diploma
* Children under the age of 5
* Adults over the age of 64
* Environmental Justice communities defined by state policy


Environmental burdens and benefits span four domains:

* Emissions: Air emissions related to transportation (e.g., particulates, smog, cancer risk)
* Transportation: Access and adequacy of transportation options (e.g., access to public transit, transportation cost burden)
* Evacuation: Risk from flooding or hurricane storm surge
* Heat: Elevated heat risk (which exacerbates air pollution and other risks)

### About the graph

This graph shows the categorical and cumulative percentages of a given population group that lives within areas designated as experiencing one or more of the highest transportation-related environmental burden categories. A highest burdened community is a block group in which there is a high percentage of one or more priority population groups (80th percentile for the state) AND they experience the highest burdens (80th percentile for the state) for one to four categories of environmental burdens (i.e., Emissions, Heat, Evacuation, or Transportation). 

For example, `r LEH1`% of limited English speaking households (i.e., 'Limited English HH') in the state reside in Census block groups that experience 1 high environmental burden category, and `r LEH2`% reside in block groups experiencing 2 environmental burden categories. Cumulatively, `r LEH4`% of limited English speaking households live in communities experiencing 1 to 4 highest environmental burden categories. Compare this to the `r THH`% of all households in the state (i.e., 'Total HH') who experience these conditions.

### About the tables

These tables show the aggregate number and percentage of the general population living in Census block groups with three or more highest cumulative environmental burdens. A block group is classified as having a high cumulative burden if it has a high percentage of one or more priority population groups (80th percentile for the state) *AND* it experiences the highest level of burdens (80th percentile for the state) for one or more categories of environmental burdens. 

Priority populations represent demographic groups that environmental justice policy and research have identified as being especially vulnerable to environmental burdens as a consequence of social or economic disadvantage, physical vulnerability, or historic and persistent discrimination and inequality. These include:

* People of color (i.e., persons who are of Hispanic ethnicity or racially not White)
* Low income persons (i.e., income less than 200% of the poverty line)
* Limited English speaking households (i.e., households where no adult speaks English "very well")
* Adults 25 years or older without a high school diploma
* Children under the age of 5
* Adults over the age of 64
* Environmental Justice communities defined by state policy


Environmental burdens and benefits span four domains:

* Emissions: Air emissions related to transportation (e.g., particulates, smog, cancer risk)
* Transportation: Access and adequacy of transportation options (e.g., access to public transit, transportation cost burden)
* Evacuation: Risk from flooding or hurricane storm surge
* Heat: Elevated heat risk (which exacerbates air pollution and other risks)
