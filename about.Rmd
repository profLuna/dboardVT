This website supplements a larger project for the [Massachusetts Conservation Law Foundation](https://www.clf.org/serving-new-england/massachusetts/) to provide guidance on policy recommendations for transportation investments that promote social and environmental equity and mitigate or prevent disparities and inequities in access to benefits and exposure to burdens. 

The objectives of this analysis were to identify the geographic and demographic characteristics of communities that are:

1. overburdened by current transportation-related emissions and related externalities; 
2. at increased risk for heat island effects, which is exacerbated by climate change and transportation related air pollution;
3. likely to experience evacuation risks and other transportation-related vulnerabilities resulting from flooding, extreme weather, and other climate stressors, and
4. underserved by current public transit infrastructure or services and overburdened by transportation related costs.

Demographic data for the analysis came from the U.S. Census American Community Survey 5-year estimates, 2014 - 2018. 
Air emissions, air pollutant concentrations, and air pollutant risk data came from the [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's EJSCREEN online tool](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen). 
Heat risk analysis was based on satellite-derived land surface temperatures from [NASA's MODIS platform](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod11.php). 
Evacuation risk was analyzed using the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) [National Flood Hazard Layer](https://msc.fema.gov/portal/advanceSearch), and river corridor maps produced by the [Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (ANR)](https://floodready.vermont.gov/flood_protection/river_corridors_floodplains/river_corridors). 
Transportation data included transit lines and routes from state agencies, average headways based on GTFS data from state transit agencies and open data providers such as Trillium and OpenMobility, [walkability scores](https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping#walkability) from the EPA, and transportation cost burdens based on the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) [Location Affordability Index](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/location-affordability-index/about/). 

This online application is built with [R version 4.0.3 (R Core Team, 2020)](https://www.r-project.org/) using the [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) package in Rstudio. Charts, tables, and maps use [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/),  [DataTables](https://datatables.net/), and [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/), respectively, all accessed through their corresponding R packages.  

Research code for this analysis will be formally released at a later date.
